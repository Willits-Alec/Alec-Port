    <h3>Week 1</h3>

    <p>Here's the start of week 1 notes. My vision is to record any physical notes here, these notes include any
        questions or comments from the readings or anything that I feel that I need to remember for later.
        In correspondence with these physical notes, I will also include a video link to my projects for the week from
        YouTube.
        This will be a brief video that will explain the struggles or the learnings for the week.
        These videos will serve as a repository for future weeks when I can go back and relearn past concepts or relearn
        past questions and answers that I have had.
        Feel free to use these videos as a check to see how I'm doing in this class. As far as the readings for this
        week everything seems rather simple.
        I got all the needed applications downloaded and installed and updated to the most recent version.
        I also went ahead and created this repository that way when I submit my notes for this class I can just do so
        with a single link.</p>
