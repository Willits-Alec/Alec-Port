<h3>Week 3 - Learning and Progress</h3>

  <p class="purpose">This week working with the team project was rather fun. 
    I have the opportunity to be the driver this week and navigate through the assignment as a team. <br>
    This has given me an opportunity to learn from others in a more strenuous situation. 
    Being able to help others and discuss the concepts being taught in the class while at the same time performing live code is a skill that I find very valuable. 
    <br>I have provided a video of my understandings for this week.</p>
