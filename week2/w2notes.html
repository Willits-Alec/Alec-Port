        This week's lesson in working with the team to understand the concepts needed throughout the rest of the class was interesting. 
        I've had a lot of experience with Visual Studio and Visual Studio code in the past so understanding the concepts of pushing polling branching and managing source control is something that I will use throughout the entirety of my time in the industry. 
        I'm always happy to spend more time on projects and things that utilize this technology.
